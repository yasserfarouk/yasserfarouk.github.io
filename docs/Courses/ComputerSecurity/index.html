<h2>Projects:</h2>
<p>You can use any programming language for these projects. The projects will be 
evaluated as black boxes. Each student should complete all parts of her/his 
project personally. Cheating will be treated harshly. If two students share a 
project (and report this!!) each will get a maximum of 80%. At most three 
students can share a project (and report that beforehand!!) to get a maximum of 
60% each. Deadline of all projects is<strong> May 29th 2010</strong>. You must select your 
project by April 3rd 2010 and register it with Dr. Yasser. You will not be 
allowed to change your project after April 10th 2010 for ANY reasons. Some 
projects will get extra credit if completed adhering to the specification and 
based on qualitative judgment of the instructor. The maximum possible grade of 
each project is written with its name. You can suggest new projects 
(using email and before April 3rd 2010) and we will inform you about the maximum 
grade for these projects by April 3rd 2010. Project discussion will be personal 
even in case more than one students had collaborated in the same project(s).</p>
<p><strong>1. Safe Chat (</strong>MAX 10<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>A chatting system that supports confidential communication, authentication of 
users using only passwords, and optionally non-repudiation.</p>
<p><strong>2. Obfuscating compiler for a scripting language (</strong>MAX 12<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>Write a program (in any language you like) that reads a Javascript code 
segment and obfuscate it so that it is not <em>easily</em>&nbsp; readable. No 
need to be perfect (it is very hard to be perfect in this). The quality of the 
project will be judged by how difficult it will be to read the final javascript.</p>
<p><strong>3. BAN logic use in analyzing security protocols (Kerberos and SSL) (</strong>MAX 
10<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>This is NOT programming. Learn BAN logic and its use in analyzing security 
protocols and use it to evaluate Kerberos and SSL security.</p>
<p><strong>4. Kerberos without timestamps (</strong>MAX 11<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>Simply re-design Kerberos Ver. 4 exchange to use no time stamps. Hint: use 
nonces. Implement the resulting protocol </p>
<p><strong>5. Replacing Login Process in Windows (</strong>MAX 12<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>Until Windows XP this could be done by what is called a GINA DLL. Since 
Windows VISTA you need to write a Credential Provider.&nbsp; In this project you 
should replace the GUI logon dialog of any version of Windows since XP with your 
own dialog that should use standard UNIX pass files for authentication.</p>
<p><strong>6. Linux PAM module (</strong>MAX 12<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>Write a simple Linux PAM module that checks user&#39;s password strength against 
brute force attacks. </p>
<p><strong>7. Authentication using Face Recognition (</strong>MAX 14<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>Write a C++ program to authenticate users using a single camera.&nbsp; You 
can use any free libraries for face detection BUT you MUST write your own face 
recognition code.</p>
<p class="style4"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="style4"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The purpose of this project is to provide a 
prototype implementation of a firewall, based on RFC 1928 (SOCKS Protocol 
Version 5). The firewall toolkit from Trusted Information Systems may be used as 
a starting point. The firewall should handle forwarding of Telnet, HTTP, FTP, 
and SMTP traffic.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><a href="http://www.fwtk.org/">http://www.fwtk.org/</a></p>
<p class="style4"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">9. Anonymous Message Broadcast<o:p> (<span class="style6">MAX 12</span>)</o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Anonymous message broadcast is a scheme based 
on the famous Dining Cryptographers Problem. The purpose of anonymous message 
broadcast is to enable clients to be able to communicate among one another 
without divulging the identity of who said what. All the chat participants are, 
however, aware of who the other participants are. A useful application of this 
type of system can be having discussion between, for example, a manager and her 
employees, in which none of the employees wanted the manager to know who said 
what. Although the manager maybe able to guess, she will not have a way of 
conclusively proving it (i.e. by performing some kind of IP trace).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Implement a system composed of two components: the Server software and 
the Client software. The Server software is where the communication is hosted 
and clients must connect and authenticate with the server in order to 
participate in a discussion. The client software implements the mechanism 
required for the client to anonymously communicate with the server. Discussions 
are formed in groups that are pre-configured on the server. In order for the 
discussion to take place all the group members must be present. The reason this 
is done will become clear later on in the discussion. The group is assigned a 
single password that all members must know in order to be able to authenticate 
with the server. A client has to enter their name as well in order to initially 
identify himself with other group members so that everyone is aware of who is 
currently present in the discussion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Implement a secure purchase order system that allows the 
user to enter a purchase request and routes it (by secure email) to a supervisor 
for signature and then to the purchasing department.</p>

supervisor will be public key based, and will be performed on a hash of the 
purchase order. The signature of the purchaser will be sent to both the 
supervisor and the orders department along with a timestamp. If an order is 
approved by the supervisor, the orders department can cross-check the digest 
signed by the supervisor with the digest signed by the purchaser. The signature 
and time-stamping is obviously important in preventing repudiation. I am 
purposely ignoring the possibility that a user will &quot;publish&quot; their key to back 
up a repudiation. Ideally, the user&#39;s key will not be easily accessible and, 
since the whole process takes place in one organization, the possible means of 
revealing a key are very limited. The biggest threat is a user using another 
user&#39;s machine the forge an order.</p>

public-key cryptography. Depending on performance (and time) this might be 
optimized by using RSA to only send a one-time secret key.</p>
