<table style="width: 100%">

		<td style="width: 50%">Change point discovery (CPD) is an important 
		knowledge discovery problem. The problem is simply to find the locations 
		at which the underlying generating dynamics of a signal (timeseries) 
		changes. This does not -- in many cases -- correspond to an easily 
		discernable change in the signal itself.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		CPD algorithms usually proceed in two steps: firstly, a score is 
		assigned to every time step signifying the possibility of change at this 
		point (it is not always a probability because it is not always 
		normalized). We call this step <em>scoring </em>and the most general 
		routing to achieve it in the toolbox is <em>cpd()</em>. <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Secondly, the scores are analyzed to localize change points. We call 
		this step <em>localization </em>and routines that achieve this step are 
		beginning with <em>findLoc</em> in the toolbox. <br />
		<br />
		In many cases these two steps are separate and one can change one of 
		them without affecting the other generating a new algorithm variation. 
		In continuous inspection applications, the focus is usually put onto the 
		localization step because accurate and fast localization is of utmost 
		important. In some other applications (e.g. physiological signal 
		analysis), the scoring step is the important one and may be the 
		localization step can be removed all-together. Given this, it is 
		important to be able to evaluate the performance of both the scoring and 
		localization steps.<br />
		<br />
		The Figure shows one time series with added zero mean gaussian noise and 
		1 P-P standard deviation and the results of applying the four available 
		CPD routines on the toolbox to it. Even with this very high noise level,
		<em>cpd()</em> can still find some of the major changes in the signal.<br />

<table style="width: 100%">

	<tr>
		<td style="width: 50%">Motif discovery is a related problem which can be 
		informally defined as efficiently finding unknown recurring patterns in 
		long time series with no prior knowledge about their locations. The 
		research in this problem have led to many techniques including the 
		PROJECTIONS algorithm, PERUSE, and Gemoda&nbsp; among many others. With 
		the exception of Gemoda which is quadratic in time and space 
		complexities, these algorithms aim to achieve sub-quadratic time 
		complexity by first looking for candidate motif <em>stems</em> using 
		some heuristic method and then doing an exhaustive motif detection 
		instead of motif discovery which is linear in time.<br />
		<br />
		Constrained Motif Discovery relates the aforementioned two problems. In 
		CMD, the goal is to find unknown recurrent patterns but utilizing a set 
		of constraints on motif locations. One way to introduce these 
		constraints when no prior knowledge is available is to use a CPD 
		algorithm and then search for the motifs around the discovered change 
		points. In this sense a CMD algorithm can be used in conjunction with ta 
		CPD algorithm to solve the general motif discovery problem. CMD has 
		applications in activity detection, gesture recognition , and 
		Human-Robot Interaction, among other fields.<br />
		<br />
		The toolbox provides both <em>mcfull()</em> and <em>dgr()</em> routines 
		for solving this problem. The first is usually faster while the later 
		provides more accurate detection of motif boundaries.<br />
		The Figure shows, an example where the location of a differential drive 
		robot wandering around was collected over time and motifs are discovered 
		in it using <em>dgr()</em>.<br />

<p><strong>Physiological Signal Analysis</strong><img alt="phyisological" src="distinguish_Feature.png" width="50%" class="auto-style8" style="float: right" /></p>
<p>RSST was used in [1] to distinguish between <em>natural</em> 
and <em>unnatural</em> interaction behaviors by anaylzing the phsiological 
signals of the partner. The results shown in&nbsp; the Figure reveal that RSST 
based features were more effective than traditional feature types for 
distinguishing the natural and unnatural conditions in a controlled experiments. 
These results reported in [2] received the best paper award from IEA/AIE 2009.</p>
<p>RSST was used in this work to find regions of fast changes in respiration, 
skin conductance, and blood volume pulse and this was shown to provide more 
accurate classification between the two conditions of the experiment compared 
with traditional statistics.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Guided Navigation</strong><img alt="" class="auto-style8" src="discovery.png" style="float: right" width="25%" /></p>
<p>In [3], we presented a novel algorithm for learning commands, actions and 
their associations in a human-robot interaction context. The proposed learning 
paradigm assumes that
the robot can watch the operator instructing an expert actor
(another robot or a human subject) and uses the proposed
algorithm to discover the kinds of commands/gestures used
by the operator, their occurrences, and their meaning in terms
of the action primitives of the robot. A feasibility study
was conducted using eight novice untrained human subjects
to assess the applicability of the proposed algorithm. The
evaluation experiment shows that the proposed algorithm
can achieve its goals and build a probabilistic network of
associations between action primitives and the gestures used
by the operator after learning both of them. The algorithm
can discover 83.3% of the gesture types and in average it
finds 82% of the occurrences of discovered gestures. 100%
of action types were discovered and the accuracy of detecting
the discovered actions was 88.3%. Moreover the induced PN
achieved 95.2% accuracy in predicting actor’s behavior.</p>
<p>Motif discovery in this experiment used <em>dgr()</em> and change point 
discovery used <em>rsst()</em><em class="auto-style9">.</em></p>
