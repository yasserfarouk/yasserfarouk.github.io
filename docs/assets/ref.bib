	abstract = { Learning by imitation is becoming increasingly important for
	            teaching humanoid robots new skills. The sim- plest form of
	            imitation is behavior copying in which the robot is minimizing the
	            difference between its perceived motion and that of the imitated
	            agent. One problem that must be solved even in this simplest of all
	            imitation tasks is calculating the learner’s pose corresponding to
	            the perceived pose of the agent it is imitating. This paper
	            presents a general framework for solving this problem in closed
	            form for the arms of a generalized humanoid robot of which most
	            available humanoids are special cases. The paper also reports the
	            evaluation of the proposed system for real and simulated robots. },

	            autonomous unsupervised techniques and positions it within a
	            structured exposition of related research in psychology,

	            autonomous and developmental approach that allows the robot to
	            learn interactive behavior by imitating humans using algorithms
	            from time-series analysis and machine learning. },

	            Agent Simulations (your pick). The main goal of NegMAS is to
	            advance the state of the art in situated simultaneous negotiations.
	            Nevertheless, it can; and is being used; for modeling simpler
	            bilateral and multi-lateral negotiations, preference elicitation ,
	            etc. Note. This package was designed to help advance the
	            state-of-art in negotiation research by providing an easy-to-use
	            yet powerful platform for autonomous negotiation targeting situated
	            simultaneous negotiations. It grew out of the NEC-AIST
	            collaborative laboratory project. By situated negotiations, we mean
	            those for which utility functions are not pre-ordained by fiat but
	            are a natural result of a simulated business-like process. By

	            the perceived pose of the agent it is imitating. This paper
