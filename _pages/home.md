### Welcome!

I am a principal researcher at the Data Science Research Laboratories, NEC, Japan  and an Associate Professor at Assiut University, Egypt.

I also hold a visiting researcher positions at  the Artificial Intelligence Research Center [AIRC], AIST and the center of Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), RIKEN.

My research interests span the areas of artificial intelligence applied to automated negotiation, robotics, HRI, multiagent systems, machine learning, and time series analysis.

I worked in academia, small startups, research companies, and research institutes collaborating with engineers, psychologists, and mathematicians.

Since 2010, I taught at all levels from freshmen courses to advanced PhD level courses in computer science, informatics, applied mathematics, software engineering, mechatronics, and robotics.

And, I am still learning ...

### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now the California Institute of Technology.
