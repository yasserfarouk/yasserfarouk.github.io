### Welcome!

I am a principal researcher at the Data Science Research Laboratories, NEC, Japan  and an Associate Professor at Assiut University, Egypt.

I also hold a visiting researcher positions at  the Artificial Intelligence Research Center [AIRC], AIST and the center of Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), RIKEN.

My research interests span the areas of artificial intelligence applied to automated negotiation, robotics, HRI, multiagent systems, machine learning, and time series analysis.

I worked in academia, small startups, research companies, and research institutes collaborating with engineers, psychologists, and mathematicians.

Since 2010, I taught at all levels from freshmen courses to advanced PhD level courses in computer science, informatics, applied mathematics, software engineering, mechatronics, and robotics.

And, I am still learning ...
