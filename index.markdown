### Welcome!

I am a principal researcher at the Data Science Research Laboratories, NEC CORPORATION, Japan  and a Professor at Assiut University, Egypt.

I also hold a visiting researcher positions at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center [AIRC], AIST.

My research interests span the areas of artificial intelligence applied to automated negotiation, robotics, HRI, multiagent systems, machine learning, and time series analysis.

I worked in academia, small startups, research companies, and research institutes collaborating with engineers, psychologists, and mathematicians.

Since 2010, I taught at all levels from freshmen courses to advanced PhD level courses in computer science, informatics, applied mathematics, software engineering, mechatronics, and robotics.

And, I am still learning ...
